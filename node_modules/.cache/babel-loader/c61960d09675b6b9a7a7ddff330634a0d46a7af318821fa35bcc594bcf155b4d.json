And after three years of research and development, we've perfected a process that keeps seeds viable while creating the most delicious organic lollipops you've ever tasted.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe biggest hurdle wasn't the candy-making – it was preserving seed viability. Seeds are living organisms that need specific conditions to remain viable. Traditional candy-making involves high temperatures that would destroy seeds instantly.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nWe developed a proprietary low-temperature process that allows us to embed seeds at temperatures that won't compromise their ability to germinate. Each seed is carefully coated with a biodegradable protective layer that shields it from moisture and temperature fluctuations during the candy-making process.\n\n## The Biodegradable Stick\n\nPerhaps the most innovative part isn't the candy itself – it's the stick. Made from compressed organic plant fibers and natural binding agents, our sticks are designed to break down in soil within 30-60 days, releasing the embedded seeds at the perfect time for germination.\n\nThe future of confectionery isn't just about taste – it's about impact. And we're just getting started.`,\n  featuredImage: \"blog-science-behind-lollipops.jpg\",\n  tags: [\"Innovation\", \"Science\", \"Sustainability\"],\n  featured: true\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  title: \"Growing Your First Herb Garden: A Beginner's Guide with Amborella\",\n  slug: \"growing-first-herb-garden-beginners-guide\",\n  author: \"Maria Santos\",\n  authorRole: \"Head of Growing Programs\",\n  publishDate: \"2024-01-08\",\n  category: \"Gardening\",\n  readTime: \"7 min read\",\n  excerpt: \"Never grown anything before?
