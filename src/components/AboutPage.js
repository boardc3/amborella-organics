          "What if candy could give back to the planet?"

          <p>
            Three years ago, in a small Laguna Beach kitchen, our founder embarked on what seemed like an impossible mission: embedding living seeds into candy without destroying their ability to grow. After countless failed attempts and a very patient partner who endured months of burnt sugar experiments, we achieved our first breakthrough.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What started as curiosity became a revolution. We weren't just making candy‚Äîwe were creating a new category of confectionery that could literally bloom into something beautiful.
